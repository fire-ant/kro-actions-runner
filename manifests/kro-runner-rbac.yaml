# RBAC for kro-actions-runner
# This defines the permissions needed for the orchestrator pods to:
# 1. Discover ResourceGraphDefinitions (cluster-scoped)
# 2. Create and manage ResourceGraph instances (namespace-scoped)
# 3. Access JIT config secrets created by ARC (namespace-scoped)
#
# Usage:
#   kubectl apply -f kro-runner-rbac.yaml -n <namespace>
#
# Note: The ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding are cluster-scoped,
# but the ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleBinding are namespace-scoped
